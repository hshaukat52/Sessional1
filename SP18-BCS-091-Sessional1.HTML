            Murder hornets from the first nest in the US are SUCKED out

                The Washington State Department of Agriculture wiped out the nest Saturday to protect native honeybees, marking the first successful attempt to locate and remove a nest on US soil. The cavity of the tree was filled with foam and covered with plastic wrap to prevent the hornets from escaping. A tube was then inserted to vacuum up the hornets trapped inside and deposit them in a collection chamber. WSDA workers were seen in protective suits working under the cover of darkness early Saturday morning (left) to remove and destroy the nest. By mid-morning the WSDA announced the plan had been a success (right workers holding the hornets). Entomologists discovered the Asian giant hornet nest in Blaine, Washington state Thursday. The nest the size of a basketball was found inside the cavity of a tree on private property. Experts had attached tracking devices to some of the hornets which led them to the site where they saw dozens of hornets entering and exiting this week.

                Lou Dobbs has slammed GOP Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox Business. He implored South Carolina voters to reject the four-term senator in November's election. Dobbs expressed anger the heads of Twitter and Facebook would not testify before the Senate over allegations of anti-conservative bias until after the election. Twitter head Jack Dorsey and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in mid-November, but Graham who Senate Judiciary Chairman, could likely have pushed for an earlier date. 'I don't know why anyone in the great state of South Carolina would ever vote for Lindsey Graham,' Dobbs said. 'It's just outrageous.'

                Multiple videos and images claiming to show Hunter Biden (left) in sexually explicit scenes and using drugs were reportedly shared on Chinese video platform GTV, which is linked to Steve Bannon, (right) on Saturday evening. GTV is a subsidiary of GTV Media Group, which was founded by former Trump senior adviser Bannon and Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui in April 2020. One of the videos accuses Biden as being '100% controlled by the Chinese Communist party'. It's not clear if the footage came from the 'laptop from hell', but some images appear to be from a third party laptop.
